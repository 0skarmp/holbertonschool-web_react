jQuery is a fast, lightweight, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM), event handling, animations, and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for web development.

Key features of jQuery include:

Element Selection: Allows easy selection of DOM elements using CSS-like selectors.

DOM Manipulation: Facilitates the manipulation of DOM elements, such as adding, removing, or changing attributes and content.

Events: Simplifies event handling, including clicks, changes, key presses, and more.

Animations: Provides methods to easily create animations and transitions.

AJAX: Streamlines AJAX calls, allowing for the asynchronous loading and sending of data.

jQuery was highly popular for many years, especially in addressing differences in JavaScript implementation across various browsers. However, with advancements in web standards, improved browser compatibility, and increased performance of native JavaScript, the use of jQuery has decreased in recent times. Many developers now prefer using modern JavaScript without relying on additional libraries, taking advantage of functionalities provided by browsers and frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js for larger and more complex applications.
